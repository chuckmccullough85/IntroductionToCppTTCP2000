Create a new console application and experiment with strings.  

## Steps
* Create a new console application in your current solution
* Add a `#include <string>` statement to the top of your main.cpp file
* In the main function, declare several string variables and assign them values
    * Remember, you must prefix `string` with `std::` because it is in the `std` namespace
* Use the + operator to concatenate strings
* Compare strings using <, >, ==, and != operators
* Use the insert function to insert text into one of your strings

* Run the program and verify the output
