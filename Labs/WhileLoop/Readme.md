| Exercise Folder | WhileLoop |
| Builds On | ForLoop |
| Time to complete | 20 minutes 

Continuing with ForLoop, change to a ```while``` loop.  Increment ```f``` by 2 degrees each iteration of the loop.
 
### Steps
* Declare a float variable ```f``` and initialize it to 32 before the for loop.
* Change the ```for``` loop to a ```while``` loop.
    * remove the initialization and increment expressions
* After the output statement, add a new statement to increment ```f``` by 2 degrees.
* Run the program and verify the output is the same as the ForLoop program, but with 2 degree increments.
